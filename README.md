2. (December Results)["C:\Users\jvanv\Climate_Analysis\December_Temperatures.png"]
- As expected, the average temperature in June (77.2) was higher than December (71.1), but only by 6.1 degrees
- The temperature varies more in December, with a standard deviation of 3.4, compared to June's standard deviation of only 2.6
- The minimum temperature in December was still "Surf-able", being 60 degrees. Though a wet suit may need to be worn. The minimum temperature in June was 71.

## Summary

This analysis shows, temperature-wise, the surf shop could remain open year round. The minimum temperature in December was still surfable, and the average temperatures in both months were almost the same. 

To get a better idea of ideal surf-seasons and when the surf-shop should be open, we should also run the same statistical analysis for a precipitation query in those months to make sure there are enough sunny days to turn a profit. Additionally, to be sure these months weren't unseasonably warm or cold, we should run a query on all June's and December's in the Hawaii Sqlite database to be sure our results are consistent with the total average.
